### Keith Chambers

*Working on building minimalistic, dependency-light and visually beautiful software, prioritizing Linux and other nix platforms.*

My language of choice is [zig](https://ziglang.org) and I've been working with vulkan and wayland so that I have the best possible base for developing truely optimal software. 

If you like some of my existing work, or would like to help support future projects, please consider donating through my company (Fairy Tree S.A.C). [Paypal link](https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/fairytreesoftware)

Also available for contract work in zig or c/c++.
