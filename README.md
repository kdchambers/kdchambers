### Keith Chambers

*My dream is to write minimalistic, dependency-light and visually beautiful software, prioritizing Linux and other nix platforms.*

My language of choice is [zig](https://ziglang.org) and I've been working with vulkan and wayland so that I have the best possible base for developing truely optimal software. 

If you like some of my existing work, or would like to help support future projects, please consider donating through my company (Fairy Tree S.A.C). [Paypal link](https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/fairytreesoftware)

I work fulltime on the open source projects available on this profile, but won't be able to do so indefinitely. My sponsorship goal would be to recieve $500 monthly, which would cover my salary.

I'm also happy to do any sort of contracting work or help collabate on your own zig project =)
